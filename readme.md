## Recipes to write up

* Madeleines
    * When covering the trays with butter and flour, use a sieve otherwise clumps of flour in madeleine base!
    * Must chill the batter in the fridge overnight. Tried skipping this: no nipples!
    * Some recipes call for a lower temperature in a second step to increase the rise: try it.
    * Try chilling the trays beforehand.
* Duck stock (Julia Child with tweaks e.g. chicken hearts: see Keep).
* Steak sauce with cognac and butter
* Steak marinade salt, pepper and olive oil the night before.
* Pizza dough (needs work!)
    * Less yeast?
    * More water?
    * More olive oil!
* Dahi Murg (Chetna Makan)
* Lasagne (Pasta Grannies with tweaks)
    * Add mozzarella (alla Mario!)
    * Try sundried tomatoes
