# Pizza

## Equipment

Pizza oven with baking stone. 
Gas: check you have enough! Buy a second? 
Peel for loading and rotating.

## Ingredients

Mozzarella: low water is best e.g. Galbani Cucina. One pack is enough for 12 pizzas i.e. cut pack into quarters and freeze three, use one to make three pizzas. 

Dough: have been using the pizza dough mixes from Waitrose. One pack makes two pizzas. They work consistently but the next step is making dough from scratch of course! Make according to packet instructions then prove up to three days in the fridge.

Sauce: simply blend quality tomatoes, preferably imported Italian San Marzano. Or follow Marcela Hazan: simmer tin of plum tomatoes with half an onion and a knob of butter for 30 minutes. Discard the onion. Blend.

## Method

Allow mozzarella to defrost slightly before grating (it's a mess when thawed and impossible when fully frozen).

Ensure dough is back to room temperature before shaping. 

Shape into rounds and cover with flour to prevent them drying out.

Very sparing with tomato sauce else pizza won't cook through. 

Allow 20 minutes for pizza stone to warm up. Allow more time between pizzas for stone to regain heat (get infrared thermometer?).

Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle with finishing salt and freshly ground pepper.
