# Pizza

## Equipment

Pizza oven with baking stone. 
Gas: check you have enough! Buy a second? 
Peel for loading and rotating.

## Ingredients

Mozzarella: low water is best e.g. Galbani Cucina. One pack is enough for 12 pizzas i.e. cut pack into quarters and freeze three, use one to make three pizzas. 

Dough: have been using the pizza dough mixes from Waitrose. One pack makes two pizzas. They work consistently but the next step is making dough from scratch of course! Make according to packet instructions then prove up to three days in the fridge.

Sauce: simply blend quality tomatoes, preferably imported Italian San Marzano. Or follow Marcela Hazan: simmer tin of plum tomatoes with half an onion and a knob of butter for 30 minutes. Discard the onion. Blend.

## Method

Allow mozzarella to defrost slightly before grating (it's a mess when thawed and impossible when fully frozen).

Ensure dough is back to room temperature before shaping. 

Shape into rounds and cover with flour to prevent them drying out.

Very sparing with tomato sauce else pizza won't cook through. 

Allow 20 minutes for pizza stone to warm up. Allow more time between pizzas for stone to regain heat (get infrared thermometer?).

Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle with finishing salt and freshly ground pepper.

## Dough

(Recipe suggested by AI, not tried yet.)

Authentic Neapolitan pizza dough is actually quite simple — it’s flour, water, salt, and yeast — but the magic comes from hydration, flour strength, and a long cold ferment. Here’s a solid recipe and method that will get you very close to what you’d eat in Naples.

🍕 Authentic Neapolitan Pizza Dough (48–72h Cold Ferment)

### Ingredients (for ~4 pizzas, 250g each)

Flour: 620g Tipo 00 flour (Caputo Pizzeria or similar, W > 280)

Water: 400g (64–65% hydration, cool/room temp)

Salt: 15–17g (about 2.5–3% baker’s percentage)

Fresh yeast: 1.5–2g (or 0.5–0.6g instant dry yeast)

(You can scale up or down, just keep the ratios consistent.)

### Method

1. Mix

Dissolve salt in water.

Add about 10% of the flour and mix to form a slurry.

Dissolve yeast in this mixture.

Gradually add the rest of the flour, mixing until incorporated.

2. Knead (15–20 min by hand, or ~10 min with a mixer on low)

Dough should be smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky but not sticky.

Rest 15 min covered, then do 2–3 stretch-and-folds at 15 min intervals if kneading by hand.

3. Bulk fermentation

Place dough in a lightly oiled container.

Rest at room temperature (20–22°C) for 2 hours until it just starts to puff.

4. Cold ferment

Transfer dough to the fridge (4–6°C).

Let ferment for 48–72 hours. Longer = deeper flavor and digestibility.

5. Balling

Remove from fridge 6–8 hours before baking.

Divide into ~250g pieces.

Shape into tight balls, cover, and proof at room temp until soft, airy, and relaxed.

6. Shaping

On a lightly floured surface, press from the center outwards, leaving a 1–2 cm rim.

Stretch gently to ~25–30 cm (10–12 in). Do not use a rolling pin!

7. Baking

Ideal: Wood-fired oven at 430–480°C (800–900°F), bake 60–90 seconds.

At home: Preheat steel/stone in oven at max (260–290°C / 500–550°F) for 45+ min.

Bake 5–7 min on the steel/stone, then finish under the broiler for leopard spotting.

### Tips for Authenticity

Flour matters: Use Tipo 00 with high protein (Caputo, Petra, or similar).

Don’t over-yeast: Neapolitan dough is slow fermented — too much yeast = harsh flavor.

Hydration balance: 65% works for most home setups. Wood-fired ovens can handle slightly higher hydration (68–70%).

Don’t refrigerate after balling — bulk first, ball later.
