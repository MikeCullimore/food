# Baguettes

Perfect—here’s a 2-day baguette de tradition recipe using both a poolish and an autolyse, scaled to make 4 baguettes (~280–300g each). I’ll also answer the organic flour question just below the recipe.

## A/B testing

- 30th August batch: final prove: one pair of baguettes at ambient 45 minutes, the other in the fridge ... what difference did it make? Ambient prove very hard to score: curved new grignette with curved blade no use, instead used bare razor, dough so wet and sticky that couldn't cut deep and shape messed up.

## Next time

- Increase quantities by roughly 1/3 so baguettes as long as the trays.
- The autolyse was quite dry, never quite incorporated into the poolish, could feel lumps in the final dough. More water in autolyse and less in poolish?
- Our oven doesn't seem to like max temperature and the baguettes scorched on the outside before bm fully baking in the centre. Try dropping to say 230°C.

⏱️ Timeline & Instructions

📆 Day 1: Evening (~9:00 PM)

1. Mix Poolish

Mix 250g flour + 250g water + 0.3g yeast.

Cover and leave at room temp (20–22°C) for 12–16 hours. It should be bubbly and smell mildly fruity when ready.



---

📆 Day 2: Morning (~9:00 AM)

2. Autolyse

In a separate bowl, mix:

350g flour + 175g water


Stir just until no dry bits remain.

Rest 30–60 minutes, covered.


3. Mix Final Dough

Combine the autolysed dough, all of the poolish, salt (14g), and yeast (1g).

Mix until fully combined, then knead lightly (or do stretch and folds over the first hour).


4. Bulk Fermentation

Ferment at room temp for 2.5–3.5 hours, doing 3–4 stretch-and-folds every 30 minutes.

Dough should rise ~50% and feel airy, soft, and slightly tacky.


5. Cold Retard (Optional but Recommended)

Place dough in lightly oiled container, cover, and refrigerate for 8–12 hours.

You can skip this if short on time, but it improves flavor, shaping, and scoring.

📆 Day 2: Evening (~6:00–7:00 PM)

6. Divide and Preshape

Remove from fridge and let warm up for 30 minutes.

Divide into 4 x ~270g pieces.

Gently preshape into logs. Rest 20 minutes.


7. Shape into Baguettes

Shape into 35–40cm baguettes.

Place on floured couche or baguette tray, seam side up.

Cover and proof ~45–60 minutes until slightly puffy but not overproofed.


8. Score & Bake

Preheat oven to 250°C (480°F) with baking stone/steel and steam tray.

Transfer baguettes seam side down to peel or tray.

Score with 4–5 overlapping cuts.


Bake:

Steam oven (pour boiling water into tray) and bake:

250°C for 10 minutes with steam

230°C for 12–15 minutes more until deep golden



Cool on wire rack for at least 30 minutes.

🌾 Does Organic Flour Matter?

Yes, but not absolutely required.

Organic flour often has:

Fewer additives (bleaching agents, enzymes)

Better microbial activity (good for preferments and levains)

More flavor complexity due to less processing


If you're aiming for authenticity and great flavor, organic, stone-ground flour is ideal—but quality non-organic flour (like King Arthur or Shipton Mill) also works beautifully.
