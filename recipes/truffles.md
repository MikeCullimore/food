# Truffles

Chocolate truffles adapted from [this video](https://youtu.be/LMPqAMfKakI?si=JpNfawvAhBnXx0wC)

## Ingredients

For the filling:

* 150g milk chocolate  (Lindt milk)
* 150g dark chocolate (Menier 70%)
* 40g unsalted butter, unsalted
* 90mL whole milk

For the coatings:

* More chocolate to melt and pour/pipe: suggest 50g per flavour but more will make it easier to melt and pipe.
* Cocoa powder (try cacao or too much?).

## Method

### Melting the chocolate for coating

1. Have truffles at the ready.
1. Put parchment sheet on baking tray ready to place coated truffles on.
1. Dice very fine.
1. Bain marie.
1. Turn the heat off as early as possible, before all melted.
1. Add more chocolate (~1/6 of total?) and allow that to melt also.
1. Will stay melted for a while after heat off.
1. Hold truffle with a fork, spoon chocolate over it until evenly coated.
1. Wipe off excess. (The less excess there is, the easier it will be to trim the truffles after the chocolate sets.)
1. Place truffle carefully on the baking tray, leaving plenty of space between it and the others. Angle the fork slightly forward, place a cocktail stick behind the truffle and slowly pull the fork away.

### Decorations

* To coat in diced chocolate, first spray the truffle in water (was better than nothing but not ideal).
* If you don't have a piping bag, you can make one from parchment paper like [this](https://youtu.be/9H771kye69Y?si=zhxwcpQfO4MM12Sr).

## How to improve

* Space truffles further apart on the tray for easier access.
* Get organised about the prep, write up in best order, do some in advance.
* Divide the filling up in e.g. an ice tray and add different flavours e.g. chili, salt, lemon, lime, mint, spices, ...
* Try different toppings e.g. grated biscuits.
* Dice the chocolate very fine before melting (minimise heating for better temper).
* Get a proper piping bag with metal nozzle!
* Turn the heat off early when melting the chocolate.
* White chocolate was too runny and never set. Try adding less of the warm water.
* Try substituting Lindt say 85% for the dark.
* Place the coated truffles on baking trays not roating tins: high sides got in the way.
* Be careful to remove as much melted chocolate as possible before laying on the tray.
* How to make the chocolate flakes stick?
* Place each truffle in a paper case.
* Place truffles in a decorative box.
* Research how to temper white chocolate.
* Use thermometer for more accurate tempering?
* Wear rubber gloves to shape the truffles.
* Get more creative with toppings/coatings e.g. gold leaf, half dip the cube shapes, salt flakes, cacao nibs... Revisit video.
