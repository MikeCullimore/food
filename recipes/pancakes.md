# Pancakes

Serves three (two exhausted parents and one hyper toddler).

## Ingredients

* 3 tbsp butter
* 285g milk (whole)
* 3 eggs (large)
* 405g plain flour
* 3 tsp baking powder
* 1.5 tsp salt (fine sea salt)
* 6 tbsp sugar (granulated)
* 1 tsp vegetable oil

## Method

1. Put a large non-stick frying pan over medium hob ring on lowest heat.
1. Melt the butter (while you prepare the batter).
1. Put a large mixing bowl on the scales and zero them.
1. Weigh the milk.
1. Add the eggs (break each into a ramekin and check it's OK before adding to the mix).
1. Whisk with a balloon whisk.
1. Put a sieve on the bowl and zero the scales.
1. Add the flour to the sieve.
1. Add the baking powder.
1. Add the salt.
1. Add the sugar.
1. Sieve all the dry ingredients into the bowl.
1. Whisk just enough to bring the batter together, _not_ until smooth: this helps make the pancakes light and airy.
1. Pour in the melted butter, whisk (again, not too much).
1. Transfer the batter to a measuring jug: easier to pour.
1. Pour/spoon the batter into the frying pan.
1. Flip each pancake as soon as the bottom is firm enough (the top will still be wet).
