# Croissants

## Ingredients

### Day 1

- 140g whole milk
- 140g water (still bottled if your tap water is hard!)
- 500g plain flour
- 13g fine sea salt
- 55g granulated sugar
- 7g (one sachet) fast action dried yeast
- 45g unsalted butter (best you can afford, high fat content e.g. President)
- Croissant dough scraps from previous batches if available

### Day 2

- 250g unsalted butter (as above)
- 1 egg yolk
- Double cream ~1 tbsp
- Honey ~1 tsp
- Fine sea salt pinch

## Method

### Dough / Détrempe

- It is crucial to keep the dough cold throughout (~13°C).
- Put stand mixer bowl and dough hook in the freezer for an hour.
- Weigh the milk and water in a container then return to the fridge.
- Weigh all dry ingredients into a container, keeping the yeast and salt separate.
- Cube the butter and return to the fridge: want it to be cold when you incorporate it into the dough.
- Put the milk and water into the bowl.
- Add the dry ingredients (but not the butter).
- Mix on the lowest setting until the dough is smooth and elastic, roughly 10 minutes.
- Add the cold cubed butter.
- Continue mixing on lowest setting until the butter is fully incorporated.
- Shape the dough into a ball and allow 30 minutes to rest.
- Shape the dough into a rectangle with dimensions w x 2w where w is the width of the butter block (beurrage), see below. Aim to keep the thickness as uniform as possible, the sides straight and the corners well defined.
- Wrap the dough in cling film and put in the fridge overnight.

### Lamination

- Shape the butter into a square by enclosing in parchment paper, folding the paper to the desired size (suggest 6") then use a rolling pin to roll the butter to fill the shape. Again, aim for a uniform thickness. It may help to press down on the block with a heavy flat surface e.g. a chopping board.
- The butter temperature is crucial: it must be cold enough not to melt into the dough, but the key is it is pliable enough to bend not break when you laminate it.
- Place the butter in the centre of the dough (détrempe). If the dough is not exactly the same width and its height is not twice that, adjust accordingly.
- Trim the dough above and below then place these two pieces on top of the butter, with the cut edges facing outwards.
- Join the two dough pieces in the middle.
- Gently put some indentations around the edges with your thumbs to secure the butter in the dough.
- Gently check that the butter and dough will bend. If not, allow a little more time to warm up.
- Start rolling, in the direction of the seam, to elongate the block (paton). It is essential to bring the thickness down very slowly, so apply very little pressure and take your time. Roll from the centre of the dough outwards in a long smooth motion, not back and forth. Trim the edges if you can see the butter has not laminated all the way (keep these scraps for your next batch, they will add a depth of flavour like a pre-ferment; they can be stored in the freezer).
- Book fold: fold one end in say a quarter of the way. Then bring the other end in to meet it and join them up neatly. Then fold the whole in half again.
- Rest for an hour (or more) in the fridge (be quick to return to the fridge: remember, keep the dough cool).
- Always roll out along the open ends.
- Single fold: fold one end in a third of the way, then fold the other end on top.
- Rest for an hour (or more) in the fridge.

#### Shaping

- Roll the dough (along the open ends) to a thickness of 3-5mm. (Dimensions? Want a steep angle on the triangles for final shape, so not too tall. Measure next time!)
- Aim for a neat rectangle. Trim excess if need be and keep the scraps (see above).
- Measure 10cm for the base then using a pizza cutter cut a symmetrical isosceles triangle.
- Measure the next and repeat. Do not measure all in advance because it will not account for the thickness of the blade, so the last croissants will be too narrow.
- (Repeat until you reach the end.)
- Take a triangle, very gently stretch it all the way to the tip, then roll into final shape, ensuring there is little to no tension.
- Ensure the tip of the croissant is on the bottom, then gently press it down to secure it.

#### Proving / freezing

- Place the croissants on a baking tray lined with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
- If not baking same day freeze immediately. It is important to freeze then prove not the other way around (otherwise they would be small and dense not large and airy).
- If baking same day, place in the oven to prove with a tray of boiling water on the oven floor to (1) keep the temperature warm (ideally around 26°C); and (2) keep the humidity high.
- Wait until they have doubled in size and are wobbly. Be patient! It could take two hours or more. For the light airy texture inside you need to prove them long enough.

#### Eggwash

- Mix an egg yolk with an equal volume of double cream (this combination gives the deepest brown colour but you could also substitute whole egg and/or milk).
- Add a pinch of salt.
- (Optional) add a small amount of honey for further caramelisation and a little sweetness.
- Brush a thin layer over each croissant very delicately.
- Ensure there is no pool at the base of any croissant (it will form a burnt crust).
- (Optional) eggwash twice, once immediately before baking and once an hour or so before.

#### Baking

- Do not transfer the croissants after proving, they will be too delicate.
- Preheat oven to 200°C (with a baking stone if you have one).
- Bake for 5 minutes (starting high temperature to get the initial rise / oven spring and deeper colour).
- Reduce the temperature to 180°C.
- Rotate the tray as needed to bake them all evenly.
- If the lamination didn't go so well, the butter can leak out and pool around the croissants. If this happens, just take the tray out and drain that butter off.
- Continue until they are a deep golden brown, roughly another 10 minutes (i.e. 15 total).
- Immediately transfer onto a wire rack so the bases crisp up (do not leave them on the tray swimming in butter).

## Tweaks to try

- Egg yolks/whole eggs in the dough (tried once, was too sticky, but both Cedric Grolet and Kate Reid do this).
- Honey in the dough.
- T45 flour.
- Pinch of nutritional yeast in the dough for extra elasticity.
- Bake on parchment paper directly on the baking stone to get heat into them faster.

## Ideas I've tried that didn't work out

- Wholemeal flour: some people like it, I do in bread but not here, too heavy.
- Leaving oven at higher temperature: led to very uneven colour (why?).

## Variants

- Pain au chocolat
- Pain Suisse
- Pain aux raisins
