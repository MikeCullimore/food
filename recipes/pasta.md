# Pasta

From Mike G's holiday in Venice.

## INGREDIENTS FOR 4 PEOPLE

* 4 Eggs as organic as possible
* Durum wheat Flour (Semola) or All-purpose Flour (00) 3 Â¼ cups (400 gr)
* Durum wheat Flour (Semola) to help you roll out the dough

(During the class we used 100% semolina flour)

## PREPARATION

To make the fresh dough, pour a 3 1/4 cups (400 g) of flour into a bowl or directly into a wooden pastry board for its porosity.

Make a crater in the middle and add the whole eggs stirring, with the fork and at the same time start to mix in the flour.

Once the liquid part has been absorbed, start kneading by hand: transfer to the pastry board or a wooden surface and knead there for about 10 minutes, with the palm and vigorously, pulling it in all directions but taking care not to tear it.

Once the dough is smooth, wrap it in the plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.

Then you can resume working the dough. Cut a piece with the pastry cutter, taking care to keep the rest in the wrap so that it doesn't dry out. Flour the piece of pasta and pull it with the sheet maker at maximum thickness and pass the dough between the rollers to obtain a thick first sheet, fold the two edges of the sheet towards the center to give it a more regular shape.

Then dust again with a little durum flour and pass it again between the rollers; this helps noodles hold their shape and gives them a pleasantly rough texture that makes it easier for sauces to adhere. 

Once you have obtained a rectangular sheet, lay it on the slightly floured pastry board and trim the ends with a pastry cutter or a knife, then divide it into two parts so that it can be handled more easily, going gradually to the thinnest thickness until it reaches the penultimate thickness.

At this point your fresh egg pasta is ready and you can make the pasta shape you prefer.

You can freeze fresh pasta raw in the various shapes chosen. For freezing, place the well spaced pasta pieces on a tray and then put them in the freezer to harden for a couple of hours. When they are hardened, place them in freezer bags and put them back in the freezer. To use them, boil them still frozen in boiling water and proceed according to the recipe.
