# Boeuf Bourguignon

Adapted from [Matthew Ryle's recipe] (https://www.matthewryle.com/recipes/boeuf-bourguignon).

## Ingredients

- 2kg beef cheeks
- 1kg pancetta do not trim pepper crust (4 blocks from Aldens)
- 2 bottles red wine ideally Burgundy
- 4 carrots
- 4 onions
- 1tbsp plain flour
- Butter big knob
- Olive oil glug
- Garlic whole bulb
- 4 bay leaves
- Thyme generous bunch
- 1L beef stock minimum
- 1kg sweet silver skin onions
- Can/bottle of beer 
- 6 packs mushrooms

## Equipment

- Stock pot (large say 10L)
- Cast iron skillet

## Method

- Dry brine the beef: trim excess fat, cut into large chunks, place in single layer on wire rack over tray, cover in salt, leave in fridge ideally overnight.
- Reduce wine by half, leave to cool.
- Cut pancetta into large cubes. 
- Roughly chop the carrots, skin on. 
- Peel and roughly chop the onions. 
- (Freeze the vegetable peelings in a bag for stock.)
- Pan over high heat. 
- Once hot, add butter and olive oil
- Brown the beef in a single layer, turning frequently. Multiple batches if necessary.
- Transfer beef to a bowl. 
- Medium heat, render fat from the pancetta. Again, single layer, multiple batches if need be. Drain the fat off periodically into ice cube trays (let it cool then freeze it to use another day).
- Transfer pancetta to a bowl. 
- Ensure only thin coating of fat remains in the pot.
- Colour the onions and carrots. 
- Sprinkle the flour over, cook for two minutes. 
- Slowly add the red wine to make a sauce.
- Slowly add beef stock. 
- Check seasoning, adjust if necessary. 
- Return meat to the pan.
- Add thyme and bay leaves. 
- Slice the garlic bulb in half, add half with the root to the pan, leave skin on (this garlic will be picked out).
- Cover with a cartouche, this keeps the flavour in. Put pan lid on. 
- Cook on low for 3.5 to 4 hours or until the beef is very tender. 
- Char the silver skin onions in a hot skillet. 
- Then braise them in beer.
